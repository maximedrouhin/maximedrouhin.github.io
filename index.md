## Tools I've made

### For Japanese learners

- [WaniKani - Translation practice sheet generator](/tools/translation-practice-sheet-generator/)
- [Tofugu grammar article finder (GPT)](/tools/grammar-article-finder/)
- [Learn the song *I say bye* by imase](/tools/learn-i-say-bye-by-imase/)

## About this website

This website is built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. For now, I use it to share tools I've created, but blog posts are coming about language learning, memory hacking, Japan, but also about piracy, online privacy, the rise of cybercrime and how to make a personal website even as a complete beginner! I'll also work on the design of this website.
