# WaniKani - Translation practice sheet generator

(This tool works only for WaniKani users - paid or not)

A few years back, Koichi from Tofugu made a wonderful exercise sheet, which consisted of... 4500 sentences in Japanese, that you had to translate. With no solution sheet. The thing is, his idea is actually â€” and perhaps surprisingly â€” deeply rooted in the science of learning. You can learn more about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q06uDobeA8g&list=PL8dUxOTCkXEp6QfaEsQ3egLL4acS-Mwo0&index=6).

Alas, [things have happened](https://www.tofugu.com/news/closing-tofugu-store/) and this exercise sheet is not available anymore. With [no indication of a chance to see it resurface](https://community.wanikani.com/t/what-happened-to-4500-sentences/58546), I've took it into my own hands to try and make a replacement for it for WaniKani users.

Here is the result: a JS script running locally that fetches all the example sentences you've seen in WaniKani â€” which happen to correspond to the sentences using vocabulary you've learned â€” and downloads a printable PDF.

  <p>In case you're worried about putting your API token below, you can <a href="https://github.com/maximedrouhin/maximedrouhin.github.io/blob/master/wanikani-translation-practice-pdf-generator.js">take a look at the script</a>, which is not very long. You can also see from the domain name that this website is hosted by GitHub pages, which means that the code corresponds to the page you're using ðŸ˜‰</p>

  <p>Limitations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The phrases are ones you've seen before, unlike in the exercise sheet that inspired this.</li>
    <li>As the PDF is generated by placing sentences at specific coordinates, there is no word wrapping. As a consequence, I was forced to remove a few sentences (under 1%) that have more than 40 characters.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Future improvements: See current ideas and add others <a href="https://github.com/maximedrouhin/maximedrouhin.github.io/issues">here</a>, and clone the repository <a href="https://github.com/maximedrouhin/maximedrouhin.github.io">here</a> to submit a pull request.</p>

To use this script, you can generate a WaniKani API token [here](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/personal_access_tokens). You donâ€™t have to select any permissions, as the script only needs to read your data, which is allowed by default for the tokens you generate.

Once you have your token, using this script is as simple as entering it below and clicking the button ^^.

As the generated PDF can get a bit long depending on your current level, I recommend using double-sided printing and/or printing 2 pages per sheet. You'll use less paper and ink, and have a smaller pile of sheets.

  <summary>If the script doesnâ€™t work</summary>
  <p>Just use another browser or device, that should fix it (the script runs on your device so itâ€™s sensitive to those things). Even if that does, donâ€™t hesitate to tell me your OS version and browser version and what went wrong, Iâ€™ll have a look into it.</p>
