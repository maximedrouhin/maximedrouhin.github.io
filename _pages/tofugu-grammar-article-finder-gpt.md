# Tofugu Grammar Article Finder (GPT)

If you're learning Japanese, there's something you shouldn't forget about, and that's grammar. If your first language is English or another Western language, Japanese grammar is fundamentally different from what you know.

At some point - Tofugu recommends at around 300 kanji in [this wonderful and very detailed article on how to learn Japanese](https://www.tofugu.com/learn-japanese/) - you should begin to think about grammar. One easy way to do this is simply to keep the [Japanese grammar section](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/) of the Tofugu website close at hand, and get into the habit of consulting it whenever you encounter a bit of grammar that confuses you a bit.

The goal of this tool is to help you with that. It's a GPT, i.e., one of the thousands of user-customised AI assistants available to ChatGPT users (including non-paying users, having an account is enough). You can give it any sentence, and it will give you the relevant grammar articles from the [Japanese grammar section](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/) of Tofugu, making it easier to quickly find the grammar articles you need.

You don't need to use this tool, though! You can still visit the [Japanese grammar section](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/) of Tofugu and find the grammar points either with the grammar categories or the built-in search feature (scroll down a bit). This tool just makes my life easier, and it might help someone else too.

In any case, the Tofugu website is a treasure trove of information for Japanese learners, and you should definitely check out their resources, especially the [Learn Japanese: A Ridiculously Detailed Guide](https://www.tofugu.com/learn-japanese/) article I mentioned earlier.
